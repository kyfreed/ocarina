        <p>This means that, while Majora's Mask has many more sidequests, the core gameplay is much longer in Ocarina of Time.</p>

        <br>
        <p>This clock constantly ticks on, and if you don't go back in time before the third day ends, the world ends. I don't like this type of pressure; I like exploring freely.</p>
