        <title>Majora's Mask</title>
    </head>

        <h1><i>Majora's Mask</i></h1>
        <p><i>Majora's Mask</i> originated when a Nintendo developer was challenged to create a sequel to <i>Ocarina of Time</i> with a one year development deadline. This game was the result. It heavily reuses assets from <i>Ocarina of Time</i> and innovatively takes advantage of the limited resources it could be given.</p>
        <h2>Plot</h2>
        <p>This game starts after the end of <i>Ocarina of Time,</i> with Link searching for his fairy companion from the previous game. However, he is ambushed by the main antagonist of the game, Skull Kid, who is possessed by Majora's Mask. Link then gets his ocarina and horse stolen. While chasing after Skull Kid, he falls into a deep abyss and gets transformed into a Deku Scrub, an impotent form which doesn't allow Link to do much. He then continues to pursue Skull Kid into an alternate world called Termina, which is fated to be destroyed in three days when the moon crashes down onto it. Link eventually manages to get his Ocarina of Time back, and discovers that he can use it to travel back in time to the beginning of his first day there.</p>
        <p>Link then regains his old form. He then sets out on a journey to free the four giants distributed throughout the world who can halt the moon's descent. He does this, and Majora's Mask, which is its own demonic entity, sees Skull Kid's failure and abandons him, traveling up to the Moon. Link has his final battle with Majora here, destroying him once and for all and rendering the mask a benign object. With Termina saved, Link can finally return home.</p>
        <h2>Notable elements</h2>
        <h3>Time travel</h3>
        <p>The main mechanic introduced in this game is the three day schedule, visualised by this clock:</p>
        <br>
        <img src='clock.jpg'>
        <p>These three days are the only ones that remain before the world is destroyed. These three days can be repeated indefinitely via the Ocarina of Time, but all of Link's items and progress around the world are lost every time he does so, not counting completion of temples or acquisition of important items.</p>
        <p>The fact that the entire game takes place over three days means that each character in the game can have their own unique schedule, which is a mechanic often used in completing the game's 20 sidequests.</p>
        <h3>Transformation</h3>
        <p>There are four forms that Link can take:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Deku Link, who can harness Deku Flowers to launch himself to faraway places and eventually gains the ability to shoot bubbles</li>
            <li>Link's normal human form</li>
            <li>Goron Link, who is incredibly strong and can curl up and roll to smash through things</li>
            <li>Zora Link, who can breathe underwater and swim very well</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Switching between all of these forms is necessary for progression in the game.</p>
