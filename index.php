        <h1>Ocarina of Time</h1>
        <p>Ocarina of Time is one of the best games that I have played, and a lot of other people think so as well. In fact, it was so popular that it inspired a similar game a bit later, called Majora's Mask. It is hotly debated which of these two is better, and I take the side of Ocarina of Time.</p>
        <p>This conclusion is based on:</p>
        <button class="btn" style="background-color: #226420; color: #fafdf9" onclick="window.location.href = '/gameplay.php'">Gameplay</button>
        <button class="btn" style="background-color: #682124; color: #fafdf9" onclick="window.location.href = '/worlddesign.php'">World Design</button>
